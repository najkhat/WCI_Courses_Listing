It contains a course name, code, subject, type and a brief description. The data has been retrieved from Waterloo Collegiate Institute School’s 2018-2019 course listing pdf file and Waterloo Region District School Board’s 2017-2018 Common Course Calendar.\nPlease, note: this is an unofficial application and has been created by the school. The sole goal of the creator was to help the students and their parents.</string>
